2. From the command line interface, initialise this folder as a git repository and push it to a GitHub repository.

3. Create a new branch called testbranch. Modify the file example.qmd and add the changes to both the local and remote repositories.

4. Create a folder called data, and add the data from Assignment 1 to that folder. Amend the previous commit to include the data folder. Push this amended commit to the remote.

5. Switch back to the main branch and modify example.qmd in a different way such that it will conflict with testbranch. Commit and push these changes.

6. Merge the changes in testbranch onto main. Show the conflict and fixing the merge conflict. Push the changes to GitHub, showing the status and changes in GitHub.
